                <p>
                    "Five Feet Apart" is dedicated to Claire Wineland, who also acted as a consultant for the movie.Wineland was born with cystic fibrosis and nearly died at age 13 from lung failure. She dedicated the rest of her life towards activism and raising awareness so that people understood what people living with terminal conditions go through and how to treat them with dignity. Her work included speaking with Justin Baldoni, best known for playing Rafael Solano on "Jane the Virgin." He also directed "Five Feet Apart," and it was Wineland who discussed the dangers of two people with cystic fibrosis having a romance together, specifically the risks of cross-infection â€” an element which was incorporated into the plot of "Five Feet Apart." Wineland worked with both Richardson and Newman to get the physicality of living with CF to an accurate place. Sadly, Claire Wineland passed away on August 26, 2018 after complications from a double lung transplant. While Wineland was instrumental in telling Stella and Will's story in a way that's honest, her story is unlike in Stella's. Unlike Wineland, Stella's lung transplant is a success leading to many years of additional life.
